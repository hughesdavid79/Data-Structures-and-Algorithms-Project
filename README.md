# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Project

Reflection:
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the CS 300 course, I tackled two distinct projects.

In the first project, I addressed the need to analyze runtime complexities of different data structures: vector, hash table, and binary search tree (BST). The challenge was to understand the computational cost of each operation for various data structures and deduce their efficiencies based on these evaluations.

In the second project, I designed and implemented an advising tool for course management. This involved storing course details (including prerequisites) and providing functionalities to query and display this information.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Understanding and selecting the right data structure is pivotal, as it greatly influences the performance and scalability of software applications. In the first project, I performed a systematic runtime analysis for each data structure, assessing the time costs for typical operations. This deep dive enhanced my appreciation for the intricacies of each data structure.

For the advising tool in the second project, I chose to implement a binary search tree (BST) data structure, primarily for its efficiency in searching, insertion, and in-order traversal, which would prove beneficial in handling course data.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
While working on the runtime analysis in the first project, the challenge lay in ensuring accuracy in evaluating the complexities. I addressed this through continuous testing, peer reviews, and leveraging academic resources.

For the advising tool, ensuring the BST remained balanced was challenging. To address this, I delved into additional learning resources, explored tree balancing techniques, and collaborated in group discussions to ensure an optimized tree structure.

How has your work on these projects expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Both projects underscored the importance of selecting the right data structures based on the problem at hand. It's not merely about getting the job done but ensuring efficiency and scalability. This realization has prompted me to prioritize a deeper understanding of underlying algorithms and data structures when designing software solutions in the future.

How has your work on these projects evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The projects instilled a greater appreciation for clean coding practices. With intricate data structures, especially like BSTs, it's crucial to maintain a well-structured and commented codebase. By breaking down functionalities into modular methods and prioritizing clarity in logic, I have come to value the importance of writing code that's not just functional but also maintainable, readable, and adaptable to future changes.

Overall Reflection:
Tackling both projects in CS 300 has been an invaluable learning experience. From understanding the nuances of data structures in Project One to practically implementing an efficient system in Project Two, the journey has been both challenging and enriching. The knowledge gained, especially the importance of choosing the right data structure, will undoubtedly guide my future endeavors in software development.
